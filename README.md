# Personal Portfolio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## `Introduction`

Hello and Welcome! This is my Personal Portfolio. I started building one after learning React on my local machine but decided to start all over again.

After building `Conversor` and while working on `Oasis Marketplace`, I was able to learn how to use TypeScript, Next JS and Chakra UI, which was an absolute game changer that allowed me to build components MUCH faster than before.

I started to build my own Portfolio from scratch by implementing Next JS and Chakra UI. 

At this point, I had learnt how to code for 4-5 months and was in the process of completing my notice period at my previous job (So that I can learn how to code full time and work towards my goal of becoming a developer). 

## `Tools`

The tools used for this project are: TypeScript, Next JS and Chakra UI.
